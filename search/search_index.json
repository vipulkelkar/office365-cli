Following information will help you install the Office 365 CLI and keep it up to date.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nTo use the Office 365 CLI you need Node.js. The CLI has been tested with Node.js versions 6 and higher, but we recommend you to use the Node.js LTS version available at the moment. For more information on installing Node.js for your platform visit \nhttps://nodejs.org\n.\n\n\nOffice 365 CLI works on Windows, macOS and Linux and you can use it with any shell on these platforms.\n\n\nInstall the Office 365 CLI\n\n\nOffice 365 CLI is distributed as a Node.js package and published on \nnpmjs.com\n.

In this command prompt, you have access only to Office 365 CLI commands. If you try to run any of the system commands, such as \nls\n, you will get an error stating that you tried to execute an unknown command. If you need to use system commands or other CLIs while working with Office 365 CLI, consider using the non-immersive mode instead.\n\n\n\n\nThe main benefit of using the Office 365 CLI in the immersive mode, is that you have direct access to all commands, without having to prepend them with \no365\n and that you can have the CLI complete your input by pressing \nTAB\n without any additional configuration.\n\n\nTo close the Office 365 CLI started in immersive mode, type \nexit\n in the CLI prompt.\n\n\nUse the CLI in non-immersive mode\n\n\nAnother way to use the Office 365 CLI is by executing specific commands directly from the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\nWhen using the Office 365 CLI this way, each CLI command must be prepended with \noffice365\n or \no365\n for short. Without this, your shell will not know how the particular command should be executed.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Office 365 CLI directly from the command line is invaluable if you want to write scripts consisting of a number of Office 365 CLI and other commands combined together. Additionally, you keep the access to all system commands and other CLIs available on your computer.\n\n\nList available commands\n\n\nTo list commands available with the Office 365 CLI type \nhelp\n in the CLI prompt, or \no365 help\n directly in your shell.\n\n\nCommands in the Office 365 CLI are combined into groups. You can list the commands available in the particular group by typing \nhelp \ngroup\n, for example \nhelp spo\n to list all commands related to SharePoint Online, or \no365 help spo\n directly in your shell.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet command help\n\n\nEach command in the Office 365 CLI comes with help describing the command's purpose, available options and any other relevant details as well as related resources. To get the basic help information with command's description and available options, type \nhelp \ncommand\n or \no365 help \ncommand\n in the shell, for example to get help for the \nspo cdn get\n command, type in the shell \no365 help spo cdn get\n.\n\n\nTo get the complete help information including background information, examples and links to related information, use the \n--help\n option, for example \no365 spo cdn get --help\n. This ability is also useful if you've already typed some options and don't want to lose your input but want to access the help, for example: \no365 spo cdn get --type Private --help\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired and optional command options\n\n\nCommands in the Office 365 CLI often contain options that determine what the particular command should do. Command options vary from the URL of the site for which you would like to retrieve more information, to the type of Office 365 CDN that you would like to manage.\n\n\nSome options are required and necessary for the particular command to execute, while other are optional. When listing available options for the particular command, Office 365 CLI follows the naming convention where required options are wrapped in angle brackets (\n \n) while optional options are wrapped in square brackets (\n[ ]\n). For example, in the \nspo cdn origin add\n command, the origin you want to add is required (\n-r, --origin \norigin\n), while the type of CDN for which this origin should be added is optional (\n-t, --type [type]\n) and its value defaults to \nPublic\n.\n\n\nValues with quotes\n\n\nIn cases, when the option's value contains spaces, it should be wrapped in quotes. For example, to create a modern team site for the \nOffice 365 CLI\n team, you would execute in the shell:\n\n\no365 spo site add --alias office365cli --title \nOffice 365 CLI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the value, that you want to provide contains quotes, it needs to be wrapped in quotes as well, for example to pass a JSON value in the CLI prompt, you would execute:\n\n\nspo sitescript add --title \nContoso\n --description \nContoso theme script\n --content \n{\nabc\n: \ndef\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the Office 365 CLI in Bash, the outer pair of quotes will be processed by Bash so the value needs to be wrapped in an additional pair of quotes, for example:\n\n\no365 spo sitescript add --title \nContoso\n --description \nContoso theme script\n --content \n`{\nabc\n: \ndef\n}`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerbose and debug mode\n\n\nBy default, commands output only the information returned by the corresponding Office 365 API, whether the command result or error. You can choose for a more user-friendly output by using the \n--verbose\n option. For example: by default, when checking status of the Office 365 Public CDN, you would see:\n\n\n$ o365 spo cdn get\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter adding the \n--verbose\n option, the output would change to:\n\n\n$ o365 spo cdn get --verbose\nRetrieving status of Public CDN...\nPublic CDN at https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com is enabled\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're experiencing problems when using the Office 365 CLI, you can use the \n--debug\n option instead. On top of the output from the verbose mode, the debug mode will provide you with detailed information about all requests and responses from the Office 365 APIs used by the command.\n\n\nCommand completion\n\n\nTo help you use its commands, the Office 365 CLI offers you the ability to complete commands and options that you're typing in the prompt. Depending how you're using the Office 365 CLI, some additional setup might be required to enable command completion.\n\n\nCompletion in immersive mode\n\n\nWhen using the Office 365 CLI in the immersive mode, the CLI prompt helps you complete your input. By pressing the \nTAB\n key once, the CLI will complete your current input. By pressing \nTAB\n twice, it will show you all available commands or options.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompletion in non-immersive mode\n\n\nAlso when running in non-immersive mode, the Office 365 CLI offers you support for completing your input. The configuration steps required to enable command completion, depend on which operating system and shell you're using.

Following section explains how you can connect and check the status of the connection to Office 365.\n\n\nOffice 365 services\n\n\nUsing the Office 365 CLI you can manage different areas of an Office 365 tenant. Currently, commands for managing SharePoint Online and Azure Active Directory are available, but more commands for other services will be added in the future.\n\n\nCommands in the Office 365 CLI are organized into services. For example, all commands that manage SharePoint Online begin with \nspo\n (\nspo app list\n, \nspo cdn get\n, etc.) and commands for working with the Azure AD begin with \naad\n. For each Office 365 service, the CLI offers three commands for managing the connection with that service.\n\n\nConnect to an Office 365 service\n\n\nTo connect to an Office 365 service, use the \nservice\n connect\n command for that service. For example, to connect to SharePoint Online, execute:\n\n\nspo connect https://contoso.sharepoint.com\n\n\n\n\n\nTo connect to Azure AD, which uses a fixed URL, execute:\n\n\naad connect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf the service uses a fixed URL, such as Azure AD or Microsoft Graph, you will execute the \nconnect\n command without any arguments, for example \naad connect\n. However, when connecting to other services that require a URL, such as SharePoint, you will execute the \nconnect\n command with the URL to which the CLI should connect to, for example: \nspo connect https://contoso.sharepoint.com\n. For more information on connecting to each service, refer to the help of the \nconnect\n command for that service.\n\n\n\n\nAfter executing the \nconnect\n command, you will be prompted to navigate to \nhttps://aka.ms/devicelogin\n and enter the login code. After entering the code, you will see the prompt that you are about to authenticate the \nPnP Office 365 Management Shell\n application to access your tenant on your behalf.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using the Office 365 CLI for the first time, you will be also prompted to verify the permissions you are about to grant the Office 365 CLI. This is referred to as \nconsent\n.\n\n\n\n\nCheck connection status\n\n\nTo see if you're connected to the particular Office 365 service and if so, with which account, use the \nservice\n status\n command, for example, to see if you're connected to SharePoint Online, execute:\n\n\nspo status\n\n\n\n\n\nDisconnect from an Office 365 service\n\n\nTo disconnect from an Office 365 service, use the \nservice\n disconnect\n command for that service. For example, to disconnect from SharePoint Online, execute:\n\n\nspo disconnect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nEach service in the Office 365 CLI manages it connection information independently. This makes it possible for you to be connected to different services with different accounts. Using the \nservice\n status\n command you can see which account is currently connected to the particular service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to SharePoint Online\n\n\nWhen connecting to SharePoint Online, you can connect either to the tenant admin site (eg. \nhttps://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com\n) or any other site in your tenant. If you are connected to the tenant admin site, but would like to get information for some other site, such as the list of its subsites or lists, the CLI will automatically switch to that site, without you having to reconnect.\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\nPlease note, that some commands require connection to the tenant admin site, and if you try to execute them, while being connected to a different site, you will get an error. For more information whether the connection to the tenant admin site is required or not, refer to the help of that particular command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nThe most convenient way of working with the CLI is to connect to the tenant admin site. Based on the options you specified when executing commands, the CLI will automatically switch between the tenant admin site or other sites that you will want to manage. You should connect to other sites only, if you don't have tenant admin privileges and yet would like to automate some of your work using the Office 365 CLI.\n\n\n\n\nAuthorize with Office 365\n\n\nTo authorize for communicating with Office 365 API, the Office 365 CLI uses Azure AD OAuth 2.0 device flow. After executing the \nconnect\n command for the particular service, the CLI will initiate the authorization flow. In the terminal, you will see the device code that you have to enter at \nhttps://aka.ms/devicelogin\n which will complete the authorization flow and grant the CLI access to communicate with Office 365 on your behalf.\n\n\nConnecting to Office 365 via a proxy\n\n\nAll communication between the Office 365 CLI and Office 365 APIs happens via web requests. If you're behind a proxy, you should set up an environment variable to allow Office 365 CLI to connect to Office 365. More information about the necessary configuration steps is available at \nhttps://github.com/request/request#controlling-proxy-behaviour-using-environment-variables\n.\n\n\nPersisted connections\n\n\nAfter connecting to Office 365, the Office 365 CLI will persist that connection information until you explicitly disconnect from the particular service. This is necessary to support building scripts using the Office 365 CLI, where each command is executed independently of other commands. Persisted connection contains information about the user name used to establish the connection, the connected Office 365 service URL, the access token and the refresh token. To secure this information from unprivileged access, it's stored securely in the password store specific to the platform on which you're using the CLI.

Following is information on these two output modes along with information when to use which.\n\n\nChoose the command output mode\n\n\nAll commands in Office 365 CLI can present their output as plain-text or as JSON. By default, all commands use the text output mode, but by setting the \n--output\n, or \n-o\n for short, option to \njson\n, you can change the output mode for that command to JSON.\n\n\nText output mode\n\n\nBy default, all commands in Office 365 CLI present their output as plain-text. Depending on the command output, the value is presented as-is or formatted for readability.\n\n\nSimple values\n\n\nIf the command output is a simple value, such as a number, boolean or a string, the value is returned as-is. For example, if the Office 365 Public CDN is enabled on the currently connected tenant, executing the \nspo cdn get\n command, will return \ntrue\n:\n\n\n$ o365 spo cdn get\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects\n\n\nIf the command returns information about an object such as a site, list or an app, that contains a number of properties, the output in text mode is formatted as key-value pairs.

This is invaluable when building scripts using the CLI, where the output of one command, has to be processed by another command.\n\n\nSimple values\n\n\nSimple values in JSON output, are returned as-is. For example, if the Office 365 Public CDN is enabled on the currently connected tenant, executing the \nspo cdn get\n command, will return \ntrue\n:\n\n\n$ o365 spo cdn get -o json\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects\n\n\nIf the command returns an object, that object will be formatted as a JSON string.

For readability, in the text mode they only include a few properties, so that the output can be formatted as a table and will fit on the screen. In JSON mode however, they will include all available properties so that it's possible to process the full set of information about the particular object. For more details, refer to the help of the particular command.\n\n\n\n\nVerbose and debug output in JSON mode\n\n\nWhen executing commands in JSON output mode with the \n--verbose\n or \n--debug\n flag, the verbose and debug logging statements will be also formatted as JSON and will be added to the output. When processing the command output, you would have to determine yourself which of the returned JSON objects represents the actual command result and which are additional verbose and debug logging statements.\n\n\nWhen to use which output mode\n\n\nGenerally, you will use the default text output when interacting with the CLI yourself. When building scripts using the Office 365 CLI, you will use the JSON output mode, because processing JSON strings is much more convenient and reliable than processing plain-text output.\n\n\nSample script\n\n\nUsing the JSON output mode allows you to build scripts using the Office 365 CLI. The CLI works on any platform, but as there is no common way to work with objects and command output on all platforms and shells, we chose JSON as the format to serialize objects in the Office 365 CLI.\n\n\nFollowing, is a sample script, that you could build using the Office 365 CLI in Bash:\n\n\n# get all apps available in the tenant app catalog\n\n\napps\n=\n$(\no365 spo app list -o json\n)\n\n\n\n# get IDs of all apps that are not deployed\n\n\nnotDeployedAppsIds\n=(\n$(\necho\n \n$apps\n \n|\n jq -r \n.[] | select(.Deployed == false) | {ID} | .[]\n)\n)\n\n\n\n# deploy all not deployed apps\n\n\nfor\n appId in \n$notDeployedAppsIds\n;\n \ndo\n\n  o365 spo app deploy -i \n$appId\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you use the Office 365 CLI to get the list of all apps from the tenant app catalog using the \nspo app list\n command. You set the output type to JSON and store it in a shell variable \napps\n. Next, you parse the JSON string using \njq\n and get IDs of apps that are not deployed. Finally, for each ID you run the \nspo app deploy\n Office 365 CLI command passing the ID as a command argument. Notice, that in the script, both \nspo\n commands are prepended with \no365\n and executed as separate commands directly in the shell.\n\n\nThe same could be accomplished in PowerShell as well:\n\n\n# get all apps available in the tenant app catalog\n\n\n$apps\n \n=\n \no365\n \nspo\n \napp\n \nlist\n \n-o\n \njson\n \n|\n \nConvertFrom-Json\n\n\n\n# get all apps that are not yet deployed and deploy them\n\n\n$apps\n \n|\n \n?\n \nDeployed\n \n-eq\n \n$false\n \n|\n \n%\n \n{\n \no365\n \nspo\n \napp\n \ndeploy\n \n-i\n \n$_\n.\nID\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause PowerShell offers native support for working with JSON strings and objects, the same script written in PowerShell is simpler than the one in Bash. At the end of the day it's up to you to choose if you want to use the Office 365 CLI in Bash, PowerShell or some other shell. Both Bash and PowerShell are available on multiple platforms, and if you have a team using different platforms, writing scripts using Office 365 CLI in Bash or PowerShell will let everyone in your team use them.",

For more information about the valid values see \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spregionalsettings.timezones.aspx\n.\n\n\nThe \n-l, --lcid\n option denotes the language of the site. For more information see Locale IDs Assigned by Microsoft: \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spregionalsettings.timezones.aspx\n.\n\n\nThe value of the \n--resourceQuota\n option must not exceed the company's aggregate available Sandboxed Solutions quota. For more information, see Resource Usage Limits on Sandboxed Solutions in SharePoint 2010: \nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg615462.aspx\n.\n\n\nThe value of the \n--resourceQuotaWarningLevel\n option must not exceed the value of the \n--resourceQuota\n option.\n\n\nThe value of the \n--storageQuota\n option must not exceed the company's available quota.\n\n\nThe value of the \n--storageQuotaWarningLevel\n option must not exceed the the value of the \n--storageQuota\n option.\n\n\nIf you try to create a site with the same URL as a site that has been previously moved to the recycle bin, you will get an error. To avoid this error, you can use the \n--removeDeletedSite\n option. Prior to creating the site, the spo site classic add command will check if the site with the specified URL has been previously moved to the recycle bin and if so, will remove it. Because removing sites from the recycle bin might take a moment, it should be used in conjunction with the \n--wait\n option so that the new site is not created before the old site is fully removed.\n\n\nDeleting and creating classic site collections is by default asynchronous and depending on the current state of Office 365, might take up to few minutes. If you're building a script with steps that require the site to be fully provisioned, you should use the \n--wait\n flag. When using this flag, the spo site classic add command will keep running until it received confirmation from Office 365 that the site has been fully provisioned.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nCreate new classic site collection using the Team site template. Set time zone to \nUTC+01:00\n. Don't wait for the site provisioning to complete\n\n\nspo site classic add --url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team --title Team --owner admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com --timeZone \n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate new classic site collection using the Team site template.

You can retrieve it using the \naad sp get\n command.\n\n\nThe resource for which you want to grant permissions is designated using its \nobjectId\n. You can retrieve it using the \naad sp get\n command, the same way you would retrieve the \nobjectId\n of the service principal.\n\n\nWhen granting OAuth2 permissions, you have to specify which permission scopes you want to grant the service principal. You can get the list of available permission scopes either from the resource documentation or from the \nappRoles\n property when retrieving information about the service principal using the \naad sp get\n command.

If you're using it often to manage a specific tenant, you can connect once and the CLI will remember your credentials. The next time you start the CLI, you can directly start managing your tenant without having to authenticate first.\n\n\nBuilding scripts\n\n\nAdditionally, it makes it possible for you to write scripts that automate management of your tenant. When the Office 365 CLI is run in immersive (interactive) mode, the connection information is persisted in memory and is available to all commands run in the CLI command prompt. Unfortunately, one limitation of the immersive mode is that you can only run one command at a time and can't pass the output of one command into another.\n\n\nWhen running in the non-immersive (non-interactive) mode, each command is executed in an isolated context and has no access to the memory of any command executed before. So unless you would store the connection information in a variable and explicitly pass it to each command, the CLI would be unable to connect to your tenant. As you can imagine, working with the CLI in this way would be tedious and inconvenient.\n\n\nBy persisting the connection information the Office 365 CLI can be used to build scripts, for example:\n\n\nDeploy all apps that are not yet deployed in the tenant app catalog:\n\n\n# get all apps available in the tenant app catalog\n\n\napps\n=\n$(\no365 spo app list -o json\n)\n\n\n\n# get IDs of all apps that are not deployed\n\n\nnotDeployedAppsIds\n=(\n$(\necho\n \n$apps\n \n|\n jq -r \n.[] | select(.Deployed == false) | {ID} | .[]\n)\n)\n\n\n\n# deploy all not deployed apps\n\n\nfor\n appId in \n$notDeployedAppsIds\n;\n \ndo\n\n  o365 spo app deploy -i \n$appId\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you use the Office 365 CLI to get the list of all apps from the tenant app catalog using the \nspo app list\n command. You set the output type to JSON and store it in a shell variable \napps\n. Next, you parse the JSON string using \njq\n and get IDs of apps that are not deployed. Finally, for each ID you run the \nspo app deploy\n Office 365 CLI command passing the ID as a command argument. Notice, that in the script, both \nspo\n commands are run as separate commands directly in the shell. In both cases, the shell starts the CLI, executes the specified command and closes the CLI removing all of its resources from memory. Scripts, like the one mentioned above can work, because the Office 365 CLI persists its connection information.\n\n\nPersisting connection information in Office 365 CLI\n\n\nWhen you connect in the Office 365 CLI to an Office 365 service, such as SharePoint Online, the CLI will persist the information about the connection for future reuse. For each established connection, the Office 365 CLI persists the following information:\n\n\n\n\nservice name, eg. \nSPO\n\n\nAzure AD resource name, eg \nhttps://contoso.sharepoint.com\n\n\nrefresh token\n\n\naccess token\n\n\naccess token expiration timestamp\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the Office 365 service to which you connect, the Office 365 CLI might persist some additional information. For example, when connecting to SharePoint Online tenant admin site using the \nspo connect\n command, the CLI will store the tenant ID. If you were initially connected to the tenant admin site, but also performed operations on other site collections (like retrieving the list of apps installed in the specific site), the CLI will store access token for regular SharePoint sites as well.\n\n\nWhere the connection information is persisted, depends on the operating system that you are using.\n\n\nmacOS\n\n\nOn the macOS, the Office 365 CLI persists its connection information in the system Keychain. For each connected Office 365 service (such as \nSPO\n) it adds a generic credential. You can view what information is stored by opening \nKeychain Access\n and searching for \nOffice 365 CLI\n.\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nOn Windows, the Office 365 CLI persists its connection information in the Windows Credential Manager. To view the persisted credentials, from the \nControl Panel\n, navigate to \nUser Accounts\n and from the \nCredential Manager\n section open \nManage Windows Credentials\n. Any credentials stored by the Office 365 CLI will be listed in the \nGeneric Credentials\n section named as \n[service]--x-y\n, for example \nSPO--1-3\n. Because there is a limit how long a password stored in the Windows Credential Manager can be, connection information stored by the Office 365 CLI will often be split over multiple chunks, where the last two number in the chunk specify the number of chunk and the total number of chunks.\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nOn Linux, the Office 365 CLI stores its connection information in a JSON file located at \n~/.o365cli-tokens.json\n. The contents of this file are not encrypted. The primary use case for supporting Linux operating system is to use the Office 365 CLI in Docker containers, where the tokens file is persisted in the container as long as the container is running. When the container is closed and removed, the file is removed as well. When you would start the container again, you would have to connect to Office 365 first, before you could use the Office 365 CLI.\n\n\nRemoving persisted connection information\n\n\nOffice 365 CLI persists its connection information until you either explicitly disconnect from the particular service or manually remove the stored credentials.\n\n\nTo check if you are connected to a particular Office 365 service in the Office 365 CLI, run the corresponding status command, for example \no365 spo status\n. If you are connected, the command will return the URL of the site to which you are connected. If you are not connected, the command will return \nfalse\n.\n\n\nTo disconnect from the specific Office 365 service, run the corresponding Office 365 CLI, for example, to disconnect from SharePoint Online and remove all persisted connection information, run \no365 spo disconnect\n.",

The Office 365 CLI uses the OAuth protocol to authorize with Office 365 and its services. OAuth flows in Office 365 are facilitated by Azure Active Directory.\n\n\nAzure AD application used by the Office 365 CLI\n\n\nOffice 365 CLI gets access to Office 365 through a custom Azure AD application named \nPnP Office 365 Management Shell\n. If you don't want to consent this application in your tenant, you can use a different application instead.\n\n\nWhen specifying a custom Azure AD application to be used by the Office 365 CLI, you can either choose to use one application for all Office 365 services or a separate application for each service. To use one Azure AD application for all Office 365 CLI commands, set the \nOFFICE365CLI_AADAPPID\n environment variable to the ID of your Azure AD application. If you want to use a different Azure AD application for each Office 365 service use the following environment variables:\n\n\n\n\nOFFICE365CLI_AADAADAPPID\n - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with Azure AD Graph\n\n\nOFFICE365CLI_AADGRAPHAPPID\n - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with the Microsoft Graph\n\n\nOFFICE365CLI_AADSPOAPPID\n - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with SharePoint Online\n\n\n\n\nOffice 365 CLI requires the following permissions to Office 365 services:\n\n\n\n\nOffice 365 SharePoint Online (Microsoft.SharePoint)\n\n\nHave full control of all site collections\n\n\nRead user profiles\n\n\nRead and write managed metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Graph\n\n\nInvite guest users to the organization\n\n\nRead and write all groups\n\n\nRead and write directory data\n\n\nAccess directory as the signed in user\n\n\nRead and write identity providers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows Azure Active Directory\n\n\nAccess the directory as the signed-in user\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\nAfter changing the ID of the Azure AD application used by the Office 365 CLI refresh the existing connections to Office 365 using the corresponding \nservice\n connect\n command. If you try to use the existing connection, Office 365 CLI will fail when trying to refresh the existing access token.\n\n\n\n\nAccess and refresh tokens in the Office 365 CLI\n\n\nAfter completing the OAuth flow, the CLI receives from Azure Active Directory a refresh- and an access token. Each web request to Office 365 APIs contains the access token which authorizes the Office 365 CLI to execute the particular operation. When the access token expires, the CLI uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token. When the refresh token expires, the user has to reconnect to Office 365 to obtain a new refresh token.\n\n\nServices and commands\n\n\nEach command in the Office 365 CLI belongs to a service, for example the \nspo site add\n command, which creates a new modern site, belongs to the SharePoint Online service, while the \naad sp get\n command, which lists Azure Active Directory service principals, belongs to the Azure Active Directory Graph service. Each service in Office 365 is a different Azure Active Directory authorization resource and requires a separate access token. When working with the CLI, you can be simultaneously connected to multiple services. Each command in the CLI knows which Office 365 service it communicates with and for which resource it should have a valid access token.\n\n\nCommunicating with Office 365\n\n\nBefore a command can connect to Office 365, it requires a valid access token. Office 365 CLI offers you two methods to obtain a valid access token: \nAuth.ensureAccessToken\n and \nAuth.getAccessToken\n. While the methods seem similar, they work differently and are meant for different purposes.\n\n\nRefresh access token for the current resource\n\n\nIf you're building a command that operates on the same URL, as the service to which the user is connected, you should use the \nAuth.ensureAccessToken\n method to refresh the token. Not only does this method resolve to a valid access token, which you can use directly in your code, but also stores the new access- and refresh token in the \nauth.service\n object from which you can use in any point in code.\n\n\nFor example: you're building a command that retrieves the list of service principals from the Azure Active Directory (\naad sp get\n). The command uses the Azure Active Directory Graph API (\nhttps://graph.windows.net\n) for this. Since the resource URL of the AAD Graph service (\nhttps://graph.windows.net\n) and the URL of the API that the command has to call (\nhttps://graph.windows.net/myorganization/servicePrincipals\n) are both located on the same domain \nhttps://graph.windows.net\n, you should call the \nAuth.ensureAccessToken\n method to obtain a valid access token for the AAD Graph service, before calling the API.\n\n\nAs another example, let's take a method that communicates with the SharePoint Online tenant admin API to set a tenant property (\nspo storageentity set\n). While using the \nspo connect\n command, users can connect to any SharePoint site, the \nspo storageentity set\n command requires the user to be connected to the SharePoint tenant admin site. As a result, both the URL of the service, to which the user is connected (\nhttps://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com\n) and the URL of the API used by the service (\nhttps://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/client.svc/ProcessQuery\n) are located on the same domain \nhttps://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com\n, which is why you should call the \nAuth.ensureAccessToken\n method to obtain a valid access for the SharePoint Online tenant admin site, before calling the API.\n\n\nObtain a valid access token for a different resource\n\n\nIn some cases, while the user is connected to one service (with a corresponding resource), you need to retrieve a valid access token for a different resource. This is often the case when building SharePoint commands. In Office 365, SharePoint resources are spread over the following different domains: \ncontoso-admin.sharepoint.com\n - which hosts the SharePoint Online tenant admin site, \ncontoso.sharepoint.com\n - which hosts regular SharePoint sites and \ncontoso-my.sharepoint.com\n - which hosts users' OneDrive sites. From Azure Active Directory point of view, all these domains are perceived as separate resources and require different access tokens.\n\n\nIf you're building a command that allows users to specify a URL on which the operation should be performed, such as \nspo app install\n, you cannot make any assumptions of the service to which they're connected, and you should obtain a valid access token for the resources corresponding to the URL specified by the user, using the \nAuth.getResourceToken\n method. While the \nAuth.getResourceToken\n method also returns a valid access token for the specified resource, it doesn't update the connection information on the \nauth.service\n object.\n\n\nWhy two different methods to get tokens\n\n\nIn the Office 365 CLI, connecting to Office 365 services is interactive and requires user input. If commands relied on context information from the site, to which users are connected, it would be impossible to build scripts using the Office 365 CLI commands.\n\n\nSome SharePoint commands require to be executed in the context of the tenant admin site. Some commands additionally require specifying tenant information. For performance reasons, this information is retrieved only initially, when connecting to SharePoint, if the specified site to connect to is a tenant admin site. Because tenant information doesn't change, there is no point in retrieving it on every call to SharePoint. If users would first connect to a regular SharePoint site, and would then switch to the tenant admin site, the tenant information would be missing and the commands requiring it would fail.\n\n\nRules of thumb\n\n\n\n\nif you're building a command for a service other than SharePoint Online, you will most likely use the \nAuth.ensureAccessToken\n method\n\n\nif the command you're building allows the user to specify a URL on which the API is called, you should use the \nAuth.getAccessToken\n method to get access token for the URL specified by the user",

If you want to use a different Azure AD application for each Office 365 service use the following environment variables:   OFFICE365CLI_AADAADAPPID  - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with Azure AD Graph  OFFICE365CLI_AADGRAPHAPPID  - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with the Microsoft Graph  OFFICE365CLI_AADSPOAPPID  - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with SharePoint Online   Office 365 CLI requires the following permissions to Office 365 services:   Office 365 SharePoint Online (Microsoft.SharePoint)  Have full control of all site collections  Read user profiles  Read and write managed metadata    Microsoft Graph  Invite guest users to the organization  Read and write all groups  Read and write directory data  Access directory as the signed in user  Read and write identity providers    Windows Azure Active Directory  Access the directory as the signed-in user      Attention  After changing the ID of the Azure AD application used by the Office 365 CLI refresh the existing connections to Office 365 using the corresponding  service  connect  command. If you try to use the existing connection, Office 365 CLI will fail when trying to refresh the existing access token.",

Not only does this method resolve to a valid access token, which you can use directly in your code, but also stores the new access- and refresh token in the  auth.service  object from which you can use in any point in code.  For example: you're building a command that retrieves the list of service principals from the Azure Active Directory ( aad sp get ). The command uses the Azure Active Directory Graph API ( https://graph.windows.net ) for this. Since the resource URL of the AAD Graph service ( https://graph.windows.net ) and the URL of the API that the command has to call ( https://graph.windows.net/myorganization/servicePrincipals ) are both located on the same domain  https://graph.windows.net , you should call the  Auth.ensureAccessToken  method to obtain a valid access token for the AAD Graph service, before calling the API.  As another example, let's take a method that communicates with the SharePoint Online tenant admin API to set a tenant property ( spo storageentity set ). While using the  spo connect  command, users can connect to any SharePoint site, the  spo storageentity set  command requires the user to be connected to the SharePoint tenant admin site. As a result, both the URL of the service, to which the user is connected ( https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com ) and the URL of the API used by the service ( https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/client.svc/ProcessQuery ) are located on the same domain  https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com , which is why you should call the  Auth.ensureAccessToken  method to obtain a valid access for the SharePoint Online tenant admin site, before calling the API.",

From Azure Active Directory point of view, all these domains are perceived as separate resources and require different access tokens.  If you're building a command that allows users to specify a URL on which the operation should be performed, such as  spo app install , you cannot make any assumptions of the service to which they're connected, and you should obtain a valid access token for the resources corresponding to the URL specified by the user, using the  Auth.getResourceToken  method.

Depending how you're using the Office 365 CLI, some additional setup might be required to enable command completion.\n\n\nImmersive mode\n\n\nOne way to use the Office 365 CLI is to start it in the immersive mode. By typing in your shell \no365\n or \noffice365\n, you start the Office 365 CLI and your command prompt changes to \no365$\n. At that point, the Office 365 CLI takes over your shell and interprets all of your input. To complete the command you're typing, simply start typing the word and press \nTAB\n. To see the list of available commands, matching your input, press \nTAB\n twice.\n\n\nNon-immersive mode\n\n\nWhen using the Office 365 CLI in the non-immersive mode, you execute complete Office 365 CLI commands in your shell. Rather than starting the Office 365 CLI by typing \no365\n or \noffice365\n, you type the whole command, like \no365 spo app list\n. Also when running in non-immersive mode, the Office 365 CLI offers you support for completing your input. The configuration steps required to enable command completion, depend on which operating system and shell you're using.\n\n\nClink (cmder)\n\n\nOn Windows, the Office 365 CLI offers support for completing commands in \ncmder\n and other shells using \nClink\n.\n\n\nEnable Clink completion\n\n\nTo enable completion:\n\n\n\n\nStart your shell\n\n\nChange the working directory to where your shell stores completion plugins. For cmder, it's \n%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\clink-completions\n, where \n%CMDER_ROOT%\n is the folder where you installed cmder.\n\n\nExecute: \no365 --completion:clink:generate \n o365.lua\n.

To see the options available for the current command, type \n-\ntab\ntab\n, for example \no365 spo app list -\ntab\ntab\n will list all options available for the \no365 spo app list\n command.\n\n\nDisable Clink completion\n\n\nTo disable completion, delete the \no365.lua\n file you generated previously and restart your shell.\n\n\nUpdate Clink completion\n\n\nCommand completion is based on a static file. After updating the Office 365 CLI, you should update the completion file as described in the \nEnable completion\n section so that the completion file reflects the latest commands in the Office 365 CLI.\n\n\nZsh, Bash and Fish\n\n\nIf you're using Zsh, Bash or Fish as your shell, you can benefit of Office 365 CLI command completion as well, when typing commands directly in the shell. The completion is based on the \nOmelette\n package.\n\n\nEnable sh completion\n\n\nTo enable completion:\n\n\n\n\nStart your shell\n\n\nExecute \no365 --completion:sh:setup\n. This will generate the \ncommands.json\n file in the same folder where the Office 365 CLI is installed, listing all available commands and their options. Additionally, it will register completion in your shell profile file (for Zsh \n~/.zshrc\n) using the \nOmelette's automated install\n.\n\n\nRestart your shell\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to complete your input, eg. typing \no365 s\ntab\n will complete it to \no365 spo\n and typing \no365 spo \ntab\ntab\n will list all SharePoint Online commands available in Office 365 CLI. To see the options available for the command, type \n-\ntab\ntab\n, for example \no365 spo app list -\ntab\ntab\n will list all options available for the \no365 spo app list\n command. If the command is completed, the completion will automatically start suggestions with a \n-\n indicating that you have matched a command and can now specify its options. Command options you've already used are removed from the suggestions list, but the completion doesn't take into account short and long variant of the same option. If you specified the \n--output\n option in your command, \n--option\n will not be displayed in the list of suggestions, but \n-o\n will.\n\n\nDisable sh completion\n\n\nTo disable completion, edit your shell's profile file (for Zsh \n~/.zshrc\n) and remove the following lines:\n\n\n# begin o365 completion\n\n. \n(\no365 --completion\n)\n\n\n# end o365 completion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the profile file and restart the shell for the changes to take effect.\n\n\nUpdate sh completion\n\n\nCommand completion is based on the static \ncommands.json\n file located in the folder where the Office 365 CLI is installed.
