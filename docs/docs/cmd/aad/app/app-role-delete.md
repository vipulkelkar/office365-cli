## Remarks

For best performance use the `appObjectId` option to reference the Azure AD application registration from which to delete the role. If you use `appId` or `appName`, this command will first need to find the corresponding object ID for that application.

If the command finds multiple Azure AD application registrations with the specified app name, it will prompt you to disambiguate which app it should use, listing the discovered object IDs.

If the command finds multiple roles with the specified role name, it will prompt you to disambiguate which role it should use, listing the claim values.

If the role to be deleted is 'Enabled', this command will disable the role first and then delete.
